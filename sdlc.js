// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Testing & Integration
// Implementation
// Maintain




//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step which involves gathering and understanding the needs of stakeholders to define the software requirements."
const design = "This is the third step in which the complete architecture of the software is designed and documented"
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fourt step which involves verifying that the software functions as expected and is properly integrated with other systems"
const implementation = "This is the fifth step which involves actual coding to develop the software according to the design requiements"
const maintain = "This is the sixth and final step which involves focusing on providing continuous support, fixing errors, updating code base and enhancing the software as per need basis."
